# Image Matching
This project aims to familiarize with image transformations, local invariant
feature detection, description, and matching. The project is organized into three main parts,
each of which requires different techniques. For each part, I developed mine
algorithm.

# Image Classification using Fully Connected Neural Networks: Design, Training, and Evaluation
The purpose of this project is to familiarize with the fundamental deep
learning solutions to computer vision problems and the framework for classification problems. The
project aims to give insights into deep learning-based computer vision research and its
evaluation methods.
